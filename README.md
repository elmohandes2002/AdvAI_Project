# AdvAI_Project
Both files contain the codes and environments to accomodate multiple bots to make a swarm.
The main difference is that AIMo has mostly the same training code, with the addition of sensors to allow for collision avoidance (punishment for exceeding a certain value).
The other folder contains code that does not have these sensors, but is meant to have each episode have a maximum of 50k steps, with learning occuring every 1k.
